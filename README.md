## Welcome 
Hi, my name is Eva Lancaster. I am a statistical geneticist specializing in psychiatric and women's health outcomes. I have a Ph.D. in Quantitative Human Genetics from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) School of Medicine and I am working as a Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Awards (IRACDA) fellow, a dual research and teaching position primarily based at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG). My current work primarily focuses on investigating polygenic relationships between psychiatric disorders and comorbidities, particuarly in populations underrepresented in genetics research. I have also been known to dabble in DNA methylation and gene expression.
